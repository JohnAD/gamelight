# GameLight

This package implements a set of modules for drawing 2D graphics on a HTML5
canvas and offers some primitive 2D collision detection.

This has been pulled from another project so it is currently a little rough
around the edges. But hopefully with time it will be polished.

## Installation

```
nimble install gamelight
```
